    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
    such
    as the
    grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. <p>Rooster or cock is a term for an
        adult
        male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
        female
        bird
        is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a
    source of
    food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is
    still practiced in some places.

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs
    and
    raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order', with dominant
    individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
    temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger
    birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.

    <h2>Vocalizations</h2>
    When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well
    as
    picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and
    encourage
    them to eat.
    <p></p>A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.
    However,
    roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.
    Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls
    when
    they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.
